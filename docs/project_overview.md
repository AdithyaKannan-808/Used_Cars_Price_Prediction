#  Project Overview

This project predicts the resale price of used cars using machine learning.  
It applies a full ML workflow, including data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, modelling, evaluation, and interpretation.

The dataset contains used-car listings with features such as car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, seller type, and ownership history.  
The goal is to estimate a **fair market value** and identify factors that influence car prices.
